ÂµPlayer (as in microPlayer) is an easy to use, cross-browser HTML5/JavaScript audio player. It replaces the default <audio> tag controls with a customizable interface that allows you to maintain a consistent look across supported browsers (Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera). It enables play/pause, seek, title display, and time display. Although quite minimalist in design, it should prove to be elegant and effective in your site layout compared to the browser defaults which vary by vendor. All of what you need, nothing you don't...
